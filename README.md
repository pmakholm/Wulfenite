What is Wulfenite
=================

Wulfenite is the code name for a new programming language. 

The design of Wulfenite is based on a combination of features I would like to
see in a modern programming language. The goal is works as my input to the
discussion about the direction of modern langauges. So don't expect Wulfenite
to strive in any way to become the Next Big Hype.

How to participiate
===================

The short answer: You don't...

The longer answer: Wulfenite is my personal vision and playground and I want it 
to stay that way. I am open for discussions, but I will not include your pet
feature and the bike-shed is going to be my color.

If you like what I am doing but want to take it in another direction, please
fork the project, please tell me about it, but do't expect me to merge changes.
(Not that I consider it probable but I want to be upfront about it)
